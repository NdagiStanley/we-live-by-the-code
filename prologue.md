# Introduction

#WeLiveByTheCode

This book is being written on the belief that the Word of God (which is coded) is the primary manual for life.

I thank everyone who has made/(is making) an impact on my life directly and indirectly. First off, my biological and spiritual parents, my kin biological or otherwise, the fellowships I have been to, visited, or still an active member in; and the relationships, insights, discipline, and world-view that my alma mater, the organizations I have worked in and the people I have had the pleasure and privilege of working with, have inclucated in my life.
