# Introduction

#We live by the code

This book is being written on the belief that the Word of God (which is coded) is the primary manual for life.

I thank everyone who made an impact on my life directly and indirectly. First off, my parents. Then my spiritual or otherwise mentors. Then the fellowships I have been to visiting or an active member. My Alma mater.
